## state

phase: v1 published (6 principles, CC0)
build: n/a (it's a standard, not code)
health: green
last-commit: 2026-06-09T16:07:24-07:00
uncommitted: 2 files
freshness: live (written 2026-06-18T22:50:00Z)

## knows

- 6 principles of honest systems: truth of state, visible failure, inspectable decisions, stated freshness, honest names, labelled certainty
- conformance: principles 1,2,4,6 are machine-checkable (via whitehack linter); 3,5 are human judgement
- coverage: software, cloud/ops, security, protocol, process
- its own limits (principle 6 binds it: not law, not a security guarantee, not a certificate)
- STATE.md — the self-declaration format that extends the Clear Standard into a discovery protocol

## can

- be read by any human or agent in ~2 minutes
- be adopted by any project (CC0, no attribution required)
- be translated (繁體中文 exists; more welcome)
- be checked by whitehack (its companion linter, 8 checks across JS/TS and Solidity)
- declare any system's state via STATE.md

## needs

- whitehack to grow more checks (currently 8, could cover more patterns)
- more translations (only EN + zh-Hant exist)
- adoption (it's a direction, not a certificate — it spreads by being useful)
- STATE.md implementations across the Desktop projects (opal done, others next)
